# ETL EXAMPLE #

You are reading the `README.md` file in the `ETL_1` repository for Russ Robbins.  The purpose of this README.md file is to introduce you to an extended ETL (**E**xtraction,**T**ransformation, and **L**oad) example.

Introduction to the ETL Example
---

The reason I am sharing this project on GitHub is to show compentence:


1. planning a small project
2. documenting a small project
3. using an Oracle database and its affiliated tools (e.g., SQL*Loader)
4. using a programming language such as Python to automate much of the process. 

However, the results of this project (in combination with other, similar small projects) will enable me to create a portfolio of predictive health analytics examples, using publicly available health data, from 1994 to 2002.

The first set of data for that project is a set of approximately 50,000 records from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) from 1994. Within this NHIS 1994 data, The first few steps in this project will focus only on one subset of the NHIS 1994 data. That subset of data has records about households that responded to the survey.

The steps in this ETL Example and their affiliated repositories are shown below:
---

 - Step 1: The overview you are reading is in the current repository, which is named ETL_1.
 - Step 2: Files related to studying the household data are the ETL_2 repository.
 - Step 3: Files related to designing a "manual" ETL process are in ETL_3
 - Step 4: Files related to performing the "manual" ETL process are in ETL_4
 - Step 5: Files related to assessing the "manual" ETL process are in ETL_5
 - Additional steps will be added as I proceed...
 
Aside from this README.md file, this repository also contains NHIS 1994 files downloaded directly from the [the National Health Interview Survey, 1994](http://bit.ly/1ddSUOC) web site.

Please feel free to browse the NHIS 1994 data that is presented here. 

After you have become familiar with what I've downloaded, please feel free to move to the ETL_2 repository.
